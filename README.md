APS Failure at Scania Trucks

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. 

As stated by Scania CV AB:

"The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised air that are utilized in various functions 
in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components 
not related to the APS. The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts."
